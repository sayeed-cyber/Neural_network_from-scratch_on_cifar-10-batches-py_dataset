# SimpleCNN - CIFAR-10 Image Classification

after running the training for 7 epochs, the model has achieved an accuracy of **40%**. As we can observe, the accuracy has been gradually increasing with each epoch, indicating that the model is learning and improving. However, training this model is incredibly time-consuming due to the size and complexity of the CIFAR-10 dataset which was actually a 4 Dimensional dataset.

### Model Saving and Epoch-wise Progress
In the provided code, the model is saved after every epoch, ensuring that the training progress is preserved. While it's exciting to see the model improving over time, the **significant amount of time required** to train even one epoch is challenging. Below is a visual representation of the time it takes to complete a single epoch (shown in the attached image), further highlighting the computational intensity of training on a dataset of this scale.

### Decision to Halt Training
Given the substantial time investment required for each epoch and the modelâ€™s consistent improvement, I have decided to stop training at this point. While additional training may further improve the accuracy, **40% accuracy** with enough evaluation evidence at this stage is a reasonable stopping point given the resources and time constraints.

Future work could involve optimizing the model or experimenting with different architectures, but for now, the results achieved are significant and demonstrate a strong foundation for the classification task.

# How to Test the Saved Model

To evaluate the performance of the saved model on the test dataset, you can use the provided Jupyter notebook `modeltest.ipynb`. This notebook is specifically designed to load the saved model and run it on the CIFAR-10 test data, providing accuracy metrics and other evaluation details.

### Steps to Test:
1. Ensure that the saved model file (e.g., `simple_cnn_model.pkl`) is available in the same directory.
2. Open the `modeltest.ipynb` notebook.
3. Run the cells to load the saved model and evaluate it on the test dataset.

This will give you an overview of the model's performance and accuracy on unseen data.
